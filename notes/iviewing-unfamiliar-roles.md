Don't interview for roles you aren't qualified for. Good engineering orgs
level conservatively, and stipulate the candidate for promotion perform at the
desired level for a sustained period prior to promoting.

If they're slow to promote, they're unlikely to up level a candidate; the
opposite is true (down leveling).

You likely have more tools at your disposal than you think to mirror the role
today, and develop the skills required for the role you desire.

Also, you'll be confident and have a stronger interview performance
when you have the competency.

Another thing to consider: if you're unqualified for a role you're pursuing,
what evidence do you have that you'll actually enjoy the position? Garnering
experience through another means will help you evaluate.

Decide what you want, and attempt to do it yourself first.
