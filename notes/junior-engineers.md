# Junior Engineers

**Focus on stylistic preferences**

**Coder archetype**

Just wants to write code. Thinks value is in quantity of PRs, with limited ability to discern which contributions will impact the business and engineering organization.

**Tends to make incorrect assumptions about application behavior**

**Starts many things, does not _complete_ things**

**Underestimates time to completion significantly**

**Never contributes to technical discussions, or contributes too much, with commentary that distracts**

**Argues incessantly with low throughput**

Hasnâ€™t learned that we are execution. Our voice is as relevant as our ability to ship.

**Brilliant Jerk**

**Defensive During Code Reviews**

**Dunning Kruger Effect**

This can be especially true in earlier stages (~1-3 years)

**Oriented toward using tools, not understanding them**

**Doesn't know the tools they work on**

An observation: they're completely unaware their behavior is detrimental (may even think the opposite), and don't know they're exhibiting a pattern of behavior likely seen commonly over the years by their older colleagues

**Has the tendency to focus on the happy path during development and testing**
