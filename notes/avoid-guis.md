# Command Line > GUIs
Prefer using the command line over GUIs. I originally got this idea from Jem Young's 2019 [FEM Course](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/fullstack-v2/) and it's been reinforced through personal experience over time.

- Fast
- Powerful
- Scripting
-  Improves understanding of underlying tool
-  Unopinionated (unlike GUIs)

**Unqork Anecdote**

I briefly worked with MongoDB in 2018, but otherwise worked at Postgres shops until I joined Unqork in Q3 '21. During onboarding, I realized most of my team made use of MongoDB Compass, the preeminent GUI for Mongo. I'd grown accustomed to using Postgres' psql client over the years, and briefly looked for a mongo equivalent. I found the mongo shell, which doubles as a fully functional JS environment. It reminded me of the Rails console. After brief usage, I abandoned it to focus on other areas.
