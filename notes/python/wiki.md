## Installation

MacOS comes with python preinstalled, but you should steer clear of this build as itâ€™s used by Apple and third party software.

Package managers like Homebrew and apt-get are options for installation. I recommend installing a version manager like [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) first so you can install multiple versions and comfortably switch between them as needed.

## Dependencies

[pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) is the default package installer for Python; itâ€™s installed in tandem with Python, so no need to install it explicitly. It downloads and installs packages from the [PyPI](https://pypi.org/), the Python Package Index.

## Project Dependencies

Working within the context of an application requiring specific versions of
python and project dependencies requires activating a virtual environment.
See [Python Dependency Management](./dependency-management).
