# Python Quick Reference

**Contents**
- [Documentation](#documentation)

## Documentation

Python is well documented. Orienting yourself to these should help you find what
you're looking for faster:

- [Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html): Recommended
  starting point. Introduces basic concepts and features.
- [Library Reference](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html): Details the
  standard library distributed with Python.
- [Language Reference](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html): Details
syntax and core semantics of the language.

### How to Navigate

- If you don't have a conceptual understanding of a topic (e.g. modules) and are
looking for an informal orientation, see the tutorial docs.

- If you need to reference an API, see the standard lib docs.

- If you're looking for deep dive on how a component of the language works (e.g.
  the import system), see the language reference.
