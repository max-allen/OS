## Dependency Management

### Virtual Environments

Virtual environments are Python's solution for application specific
dependencies. From the python 3 [glossary](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-virtual-environment):

  > A cooperatively isolated runtime environment that allows Python users and applications to install and upgrade Python distribution packages without interfering with the behavior of other Python applications running on the same system.

  virtual envs created via the
  [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#module-venv) module

  searching for package location within and outside of virtual env via pip:
  <!-- $HOME/.local/share/virtualenvs/dst-algorithms-OjA0cdcc/lib/python3.10/site-packages -->

  <!-- $HOME/.pyenv/versions/3.10.10/lib/python3.10/site-packages -->
