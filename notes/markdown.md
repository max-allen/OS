## Description

Markdown is a plain text format for writing structured documents. Spec compliant parsers convert the language to an AST and render the document as a markup language natively supported by web browsers (i.e. HTML, XML, etc.).

## Motivation

Markdown was created as a plain text alternative to HTML for authoring documents for the web. This offered a means of producing formatted text without the relative complexity introduced by HTML elements.

The minimal design of Markdown's syntax, which emphasizes ease of writing and readability, is accessible to users with limited web development or design experience.

## Limitations

By design, Markdown's scope is limited to _writing_ format â€“ it only addresses items that can be conveyed in plain text. This small footprint means that it lacks many features supported by heavier markup languages.

Examples: Advanced Tables, Forms, Interactive Elements (menus, modals, etc.),Embedded Multimedia (videos, audio files, etc.).

Markdown isn't natively supported by browsers so it will always require processing.

## Significance

Markdown is the predominant markup language for writing on the web. Many applications, services, and editors offer Markdown support. It's widely used for blogging, messaging, and documentation. README files are authored in Markdown.
