_Why?_ No team can function well without a leader. The standard team leadership roles recognized at Google:

- **Engineering Manager**: Leader of people
- **Tech Lead**: Leads technology efforts

Newer teams will occasionally have one individual assume both roles. This is called a **Tech Lead Manager (TLM).** The people skills required varies significantly between these roles. 

**Responsibilities**

**Engineering Manager**: Performance, productivity, and happiness of everyone on their team while making sure the needs of the business are met. They can often be in a difficult position when the needs of team members don't align with the interests of the business.

**Tech Lead**: All technical aspects of the product – including technology decisions / choices, architecture, priorities, velocity, and general project management. The tech lead will often report to the EM.

As an IC, they must often weigh completing a task themselves or delegating to a less experienced team member.

**Moving from IC to Leadership**

- Google generally requires a person to perform above their current level for a considerable period before being promoted to that level.

- Tendency for managers to forget the bad management they contended with early in their careers.

"Above all, resist the urge to manage"

Cure for the management disease is servant leadership – the most important thing your can do as a leader is to serve your team.

**The Engineering Manager**

> Traditional managers worry about how to get things done, whereas great managers worry about what things get done (and trust their team to figure out how to do it).

The _Carrot & Stick_ style of management is a carryover from military hierarchy and the Industrial Revolution. Continues today in some industries despite studies showing this is harmful to creative work.[^1] Unlike the assembly workers of yesterday that could be trained in days and replaced at will, software engineers can take months to onboard and require nurture, space, etc. to create.

[^1]: See Scientific Management or Taylorism, especially its effects on worker morale.

**Failure should be an option**: Making your team feel safe and secure builds psychological safety. In turn, they will take bigger risks that can produce great success.

**Antipatterns**

- **Hiring pushovers:** Overcoming insecurity by only hiring reports that are less competent than you are. This results in you being required to assume more responsibility. You also won't learn as much.

<!-- TODO: Revisit this portion of the book and include more, good topic -->
- **Ignoring low performers:**  *"Hope is not a strategy."* Ignoring low performers encourages high performers to leave, and discourages high performers from joining. **How do you deal with a low performer?** Analogy of helping a limping person learn to walk again, then jog, then run with the team. It requires temporary micromanagement, a time frame (~2 mos), and very specific goals you can expect them to achieve over the period.

- **Ignoring Human Issues:** EMs have both the a) social and b) technical as focus areas for their team. Engineers recently promoted to EM may be tempted to disregard the social component of their teams health to the detriment of their reports.

- **Be Everyone's Friend:**

- **Comprimise Hiring Standards:**

- **Treat Team Like Children:**
