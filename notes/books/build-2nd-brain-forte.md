CODE: Capture, Organize, Distill, Express

**Capture: Keep What Resonates**

**Organize: Save for Actionability**

Organize for action, according to the active projects you're currently working
on. Consider new information in terms of its utility – is this going to help me
move forward with one of my current projects?

Few things are actionable and relevant at any given time, which creates a filter
for everything else.

**Distill: Find the Essence**

There's always a way to convey the core message in a sentence or two. Distilling
notes down to their essence is powerful way to speed up the process of creating
rapid associations.

Your notes will be useless if you can't decipher them in the future, or if
they're so long you won't try.

Think of yourself as a giver of notes to your future self, not a note taker.

Every time you take a note, ask yourself, "How can I make this as useful as
possible for my future self?"

**Express: Show Your Work**

All previous steps are geared toward one purpose: sharing your ideas, story, and
knowledge with others.

Common challenge for curious people is that we constantly feed ourselves
information, but never take the next step and apply it.

It's easy to delay and postpone enriching experiences. We think we're not
ready. We fear we're not prepared.

Information becomes knowledge–personal, embodied, verified–only when we put it
to use.

You gain confidence in what you know when you know that it works. Until you do,
it's a theory.

Shift as much of your time and effort away from consuming to creating.

Creating is one of the most deeply fulfilling things we can do, and it can also
have a positive impact on others by inspiring, entertaining, or educating them.

Synonyms for the act of expression: evaluate, share, teach, record, post, lobby

They draw on outside sources for raw material, they involve a process of
refinement over time, and they end up making an impact on someone or something
that matters to you.

Publish the site now and add pages later. Send the draft now and revise later.
The sooner you begin, the sooner you start improving.

If you're learning, doing, and feel scattered, or like you have nothing to show
for it, here's the surprising truth: you're already doing most of the work
required. You just need a more intentional, deliberate way of managing that
information and practical habits to ensure it gets done.
