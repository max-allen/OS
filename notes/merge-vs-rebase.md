# Merge vs Rebase

**Need the latest changes from base branch**

- Merge adds commits, so if you need to make revisions during the merge, those changes can be difficult to find in the deluge of changes possibly present in your merge commit.

- Depending on how stale the branch is, you may end up in rebase hell. If this is case and you're in a time crunch, merge will be much faster.
