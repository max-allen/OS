# Proxy Servers

## How to Use

This is a conceptual guide for reinforcing mental models. Use it when you can't
remember use cases, a proxy type, or how aspects of proxies work.

### When To Use

Proxies are important when it's time to deploy a service that needs to be
reachable by a client communicating over the public internet. It's more
simple (and less work) to make the service public, but the following use cases
wouldn't be unachievable:

- **Secure Access**: Limiting which clients have access to the service's resources.

- **Load Balancing**: Distributing request traffic across separate instances of
the service.

### Types

#### Reverse Proxy
