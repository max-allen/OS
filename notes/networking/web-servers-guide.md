# Web Servers

## How to Use

Use this guide to reinforce mental models, compare to another system component
like an application server, or to reference use cases. Refer to a tool specific
quick reference for help with using a specific tool.

### When You'll Use

Web servers are important when it's time to deploy a service that needs to be
reachable by a client communicating over the public internet. It's more
simple (and less work) to make the service public, but the following use cases
wouldn't be unachievable:

- **Secure Access**: Limiting which clients have access to the service's resources.

- **Load Balancing**: Distributing request traffic across separate instances of
the service.
