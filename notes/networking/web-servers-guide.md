# Web Servers

Web servers handle HTTP requests. As the name implies, they can be used to
serve content, but they have a variety of other use cases such as load
balancing, caching, and SSL termination.

## How to Use

Use this guide to reinforce mental models, compare to another system component
like an application server, or to reference use cases. Refer to a tool specific
quick reference for help with using a specific tool.

### When You'll Use

- **Publicly Accessible Resources (Deploying):** Web servers are most relevant
  when it's time to deploy a service that needs to be reachable by a client
  communicating over the public internet.

### Use Cases

- **Serving Content**: Serving content is the operative use case of web servers
  traditionally. Content may be static (e.g HTML/images stored on a host) or dynamic (e.g. JSON response from a web application framework).

- **Restricting Access**: Limiting which clients have access to the service's resources.

- **Load Balancing**: Distributing request traffic across separate instances of
the service.
