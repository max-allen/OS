# Feedback

Netflix

Good culture of feedback should start with employees giving feedback to their bosses, accompanied by boss to employee feedback.

The higher you get within an organization, the less likely you are to receive feedback, which can be dangerous as the results are more severe.

Guidelines

- Aim to Assist: Must be given with positive intent.

- Actionable: Must focus on what the recipient can do differently.

- Appreciate: Natural reaction is to become defensive. As a recipient, ask yourself how you demonstrate appreciation by listening carefully.

- Accept or Discard: You are required to listen and consider all feedback. You are not required to follow it.
