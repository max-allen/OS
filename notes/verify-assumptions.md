Verify your assumptions.

A friend and I transitioned into an industry during the same period. He was tough as nails, and worked really hard. He invested in the public route (online persona). I was really impressed and followed him over years, emulating his practices here and there.

Five years later, and I have little interest in his career path. At times I felt guilty that I wasn't doing  everything he was. However, I can confidently say today, I wouldn't approve of my younger self taking that path, given my current interests.
