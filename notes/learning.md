# Learning

> Learn a little about everything. Learn a lot about what about what you rely on. Learn a lot about what interests you.

Deliberate practice at the smallest level possible
- Immediate repetition
- Immediate feedback

Daily practice on small skills leads to large transformations in performance over time.

You don't _really_ know something if you can't illustrate it.

I need repeated exposure in order to learn. I need to be able to conceptualize and draw relations to things that are familiar. Relations between things takes hold. Details are only important if they inform how things work.

As an engineer, you teeter at the edge of knowing and not knowing. You develop an intuition for recognizing your limitations and identifying just how much you ground you need to cover in that moment to meet your objective.

How do we learn effectively?

What we don't use will degrade with time.

How do we take what we've learned and extract things from it to make it more generalizable? If we aren't able to generalize it, do we really understand how it works?

Details are far less important than your ability to understand _how_ to do something. By any measure, a poor machine is more skilled at recall than we'll ever be. Orient your study around an ability that can be performed. Ruthlessly prioritize as you march toward cultivating it. It's imperative to discern what won't map toward your goal.
