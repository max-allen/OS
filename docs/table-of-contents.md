# Table of Contents

TOCs are autogenerated using [markdown-toc](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/markdown-toc).

## Installation

Because `markdown-toc` is a node project, npm is used for installation. Set the
node version to something other than `system` and install the binary globally:

```bash
nvm use <node version>
npm i -g markdown-toc
```
## Usage

A TOC section can be added to a note in place by running the following:

```bash
markdown-toc -i <file>
```

`markdown-toc` will insert the result between the `<!-- toc -->`
and `<!-- tocstop -->` markdown comments. These comments should be present in
the note.

To review the TOC without modifying the file in place, run the command without
specifying the `-i` option:

```bash
markdown-toc /notes/infrastructure/kubectl-reference
